# minimalistic markdown editor

There are few examples available with different takes on a markdown editor.
For this one I wanted something minimal to understand how it works. For that purpose I don't need any styling.

ReactMarkdown is the kernel of this.
Other things demonstrated are:

- props
- useState
- useEffect
- conditional rendering
- fetch

When you start, the app will read a file with markdown encoding, and display the decoded html.
If you click the checkbox the text area will be replaced by a markdown editor.
Click again to se the result.
